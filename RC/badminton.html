<h3>Some things to look for in a racket:</h3>
<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Racket Material</th>
        <td>Rackets are normally made from carbon fiber, aluminium or composite materials.</td>
        <td>Carbon fiber is the lightest of these which helps to decrease the weight of the racket which can put less strain on the players shoulder and can also improve swing speed.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>String Tension</th>
        <td>Rackets are normally strung depending on the players skill level. A general guide is &lt;24lbs for beginner players, 24-28lbs for intermediate/advanced players and 28&gt; for professional players</td>
        <td>Lower string tensions can help a player to generate power by increasing the size of the sweet spot but this comes at the cost of accuracy. At higher string tensions the sweet spot is smaller which can cause the strings to snap if the shuttle isnt hit in the sweet spot but accuracy is greatly improved.</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <th>Racket Balance</th>
        <td>Rackets typically come in 3 different balances: head-light, even balance and head-heavy.</td>
        <td>Head-light rackets have a faster swing speed at the cost of hitting power. Head-heavy rackets have a greater hitting power at the cost of swing speed. An even racket balance has a mix of both decent swing speed and hitting power.</td>
    </tr>
